    <li>Step 1</li>

    <p>
    Preheat the oven to<em>300 degrees F (150 degrees C)</em>. Grease a baking sheet.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>

    <p>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add <em>ground beef, garlic salt, dried parsley, and Italian seasoning</em>. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in spaghetti sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until sauce is thickened and resembles a Bolognese, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>

    <p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add oil. Cook pasta shells in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Transfer shells to a baking dish and let cool briefly.</p>
    <li>Step 4</li>

    <p>Scoop cream cheese into the bottom of the pasta shells. Scoop sauce over the cream cheese. Sprinkle with feta cheese and parsley.</p>
    <li>Step 5</li>

    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned, about 15 minutes.</p>
